GUI and service manager for a NAS

This project is going to be a GUI and service manager for a cloud/NAS hardware project my brother and I are working on. The goal of this software is to create a friendly interface for non-techie people to use the cloud we are building. It should also handle or manage another software that will sync up a distributed system of drives.
